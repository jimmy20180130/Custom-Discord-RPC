Custom Discord Rich Presence made by Jimmy

I am not good at English, so I use Google Translate to translate some of the contents. 

## Introduction

Welcome to the Custom-Discord-RPC! This project provides a Discord Rich Presence implementation to make your Discord profile more eye-catching than others. Discord Rich Presence allows you to display customized game status and information on your Discord profile. This README will guide you through the setup and usage of the project in two different methods.

## Method 1: Using DiscordRPC.exe

1. Download the contents of the `DiscordRPC_EXE` directory from the repository.
2. Place all the downloaded files in a single folder on your local machine.
3. Open the `config.json` file and update it with your desired settings, such as your Discord application's Client ID and other game details.
4. Save the `config.json` file after making the necessary changes.
5. Run `DiscordRPC.exe` to execute the Discord Rich Presence application.
6. Your Discord profile will now show the custom status based on the settings in your `config.json` file when you are playing games or using the application.

## Method 2: Using install.bat and DiscordRPC.py

1. Download the contents of the `DiscordRPC` directory from the repository.
2. Place all the downloaded files in a single folder on your local machine.
3. Open the `config.json` file and update it with your desired settings, such as your Discord application's Client ID and other game details.
4. Save the `config.json` file after making the necessary changes.
5. Run `install.bat` to ensure all the required dependencies are installed.
6. After the installation is complete, you can now execute `DiscordRPC.py` to start the Discord Rich Presence application.
7. Your Discord profile will now display the custom status based on the settings in your `config.json` file when you are playing games or using the application.
